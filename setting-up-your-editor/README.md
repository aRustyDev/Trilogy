VSCode is one of the most popular choices for editors, they have a massive & thriving library of add-ons.

If you want to learn how to setup VSCode checkout [this](./setup-vscode.md) markdown doc

### Sublime (Paid)

If you want to use Sublime, then you're on your own, we don't have anyone who has it or has used it and so can't really supply much information.

### Notepad++

If you want to keep things dead simple, Notepad++ is available almost anywhere and can make for a decent editor.  
However it pales in comparison to the other 3 options.
