---
Author: vintharas  
For anyone who is wanting to up their terminal text editor game, VIM is the way to go.   
NANO is great for getting started, but its less likely to be on any servers that you work with than VI/VIM is. Not to mention the great typing/editting speed ups you can get from mastering it.  
Be warned though, while learning VIM basics is easy, mastering it is a task that takes regular and repeated efforts.
